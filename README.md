Repository for "Battleship" project

Coded by Lee Rhodes with help from the wise mentor Joanna Jackson
Originated within UT Libraries & will likely stay there

Totally (not) original concept taken from the board game Battleship licensed by Hasbro
Due to copyrights, code is dangerously close to being re-named Battleboat even if it just doesn't have a ring to it
